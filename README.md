# STM32-Embedded-System
This ECE355 lab project covers the development of an embedded system using a STM32F0 Discovery board. The system is designed to implement microcontroller-based tasks such as signal measurement, PWM control, and a real-time OLED display. This system relies on peripherals such as timers, ADCs, DACs, polling,and interrupts to achieve its desired functionality. The project uses tools such as the ECLIPSE IDE for development of the software and debugging, and a 555 timer and function generator for generating square wave signals. The system must measure signal properties from more than one source, interact with external components like potentiometers, optocouplers and buttons, and display outputs on an OLED screen.
